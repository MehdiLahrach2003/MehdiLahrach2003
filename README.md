**Selected Projects** : 

**Quant Journey**  : Quantitative finance framework for strategy backtesting, risk management, portfolio optimization and derivatives pricing. Focus on reproducibility, risk metrics (VaR, ES), walkforward analysis and multi-asset allocation.

**NaturalGasGP**  : Gaussian Process modeling of natural gas forward curves with uncertainty quantification. Kernel design (RBF + periodic), probabilistic evaluation (NLL, coverage) and
kernel ablation studies.

**Optimal Quoting** : Research-oriented project on inventory-based market making using stochastic control and order-flow intensity models. The project focuses on optimal quoting policies under inventory risk, execution modeling via Poisson/Hawkes-type intensities, and event-driven backtesting in a realistic market microstructure setting.

Main interests: quantitative finance, risk management, statistical modeling
