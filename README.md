### Quantitative Trading & Market Microstructure

I build **research-grade, reproducible trading systems** focused on **decision-making under uncertainty**, **microstructure effects**, and **risk-aware execution**.

**Current focus**:
- adverse selection and partially observable order flow  
- inventory and execution risk  
- probing and information–PnL trade-offs
