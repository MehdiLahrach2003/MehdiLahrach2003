### Quantitative Trading & Market Microstructure

I build **research-grade, reproducible trading systems** focused on **decision-making under uncertainty**, **microstructure effects**, and **risk-aware execution**.

**Current focus**:
- adverse selection and partially observable order flow  
- inventory and execution risk  
- probing and information–PnL trade-offs

### Selected Projects

**Probing and Adverse Selection in Market Making**  
Inventory-based market making under uncertain order flow, with intensity calibration, probing strategies, and event-driven backtesting in a realistic microstructure setting.

**Systematic Trading and Risk Backtesting Framework**  
Modular framework for multi-asset strategy research, portfolio construction, walk-forward evaluation, and risk analysis (VaR, ES, stress tests).

**Uncertainty-Aware Gas Forward Curve Modeling**  
Gaussian Process modeling of gas forward curves with explicit uncertainty quantification, kernel ablation, and probabilistic evaluation (NLL, coverage).
